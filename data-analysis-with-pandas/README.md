# Tidy and explore tabular data with pandas

## Description

pandas is a powerful and essential part of the Python scientific computing ecosystem.

In this hands-on workshop, learners will practice importing, tidying, exploring, and visualizing tabular data using pandas (the basic verbs of exploratory data analysis, with the exception of modeling).

## Helpful Pre-requisites

This workshop is intended for beginner to intermediate Python users with at least *some* Python experience. For beginner Python users, consider the following as metrics of being ready for this session:

* Learners can assign values such as strings and integers to variables
* Learners can comfortable use Python standard library functions and methods, such as `print()` and `len()`
* Learners have been exposed to conditional statements, loops, and function definitions (even if they have not used them extensively)

The curriculum will also benefit more experienced Python users who are not familiar with pandas and/or the data science ecosystem in Python.

## Learner Outcomes

At the end of this modules, learners will be able to:

* Articulate a research question-driven data analysis pipeline for tabular data in Python
* Open, use, and navigate Jupyter Notebooks within the Google Colaboratory environment
* Identify common strategies for detecting errors and nulls in tabular data, such as header rows and nonstandard nulls
* Explain the relationship between numpy data structures and the pandas dataframe
* Generate statistical summaries and simple visualizations from a pandas dataframe
